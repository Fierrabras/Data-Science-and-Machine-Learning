    "Hi and welcome to my GitHub account. My name is Álvaro and I am a fresh M. Sc. graduate in physics from Heidelberg University, Germany. In this series of Jupyter Notebooks I intend to keep an account of my path to mastering Data Science and Machine Learning techniques. My intention is to summarize and digest the fundamental theoretical results I encounter by illustrating these with neat little examples and snippets of code. Further down the road, I would like to complete these study notes with fully developed application examples I come up with."
